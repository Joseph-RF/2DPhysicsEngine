# 2DPhysicsEngine

## Description
Hello! This is a simple 2D physics engine I created for fun one summer with an external library called SFML in order to easily handle visuals as well as input from th keyboard during the programme's runtime. The code allows you to simulate rigid spheres colliding with each other as well as pairs of these same spheres connected by springs.

It is inspired by the work done by [johnBuffer](https://github.com/johnBuffer/VerletSFML) here on GitHub.

P.S. This is my first attempt at using Git with a project and pushing it to GitHub. Excuse the ugly README.

## Instructions
*Requirements*

In order to run this code you will first need to install SFML.

I would recommend the following quick tutorial by [EOD - Ethan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFzpkvrscs4) on YouTube. 

From here it should be as simpel as just running the code in Visual Studio.

## Features

For now, this project features two main entities: Simple rigid spheres and pairs of the same spheres attached by a spring.

They can be added to the scene by simply pressing "s" and "r" on the keyboard respectively.
