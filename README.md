# 2DPhysicsEngine

## Description
Hello! This is a simple 2D physics engine I created for fun one summer which an external library called SFML in order to easily handle visuals as well as input from th keyboard during the programme's runtime. The code allows you to simulate rigid balls colliding with each other as well as pairs of these same balls connected by springs.

It is heavily inspired by the work done by @johnBuffer here on GitHub. 

P.S. This is my first attempt at using Git with a project and pushing it to GitHub. Excuse the ugly README.

## Instructions
